# Mini-Projects
A collection of mini projects that tend to have a small number of objectives

## Hex Colours
The user inputs the red, blue and green values of a colour. These values are then converted into hexadecimal. The user can use this hexadecimal value in a CSS file, for example.

## Denary Into Hex and Binary
The user inputs a denary number and the denary, binary and hex values of this number is outputted. The process of inputting the number and
outputting the results can be carried out as many times as the user wishes.

## Password Generator
This is a program that helps people to generate secure passwords. The program ensures that the password will be greater than 6 characters in length. The user can create as many passwords as they wish.

## Decimal to Binary Converter
This is a program written in C# that has a similar functionality as the Denary Into Hex and Binary Python program. I made this program while I was doing the binary numbers challenge on HackerRank, so I decided to transfer my work from there. The user inputs a number in base 10 (denary) and it is converted into base 2 (binary). Colour coding is used in this program.
